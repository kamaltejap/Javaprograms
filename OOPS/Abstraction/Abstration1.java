   Hiding internal implementation and highlighting the set of services is called abstraction.

Using abstract classes and interfaces we can implements abstraction.

The best example of abstraction is GUI ATM machine because bank people will hide internal implementation and highlights the set of services like banking, withdrawl, mini statement and etc.

The main advantages of abstraction are.

1) It gives security because it will hide internal implementation.

2) Enhancement becomes more easy because without effecing enduser they can perform any changes 
   in our internal system.

3) It provides flexibility to the enduser to use the system.
