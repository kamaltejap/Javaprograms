/*
     polymorphism has taken from Greek word.
Here poly means many and morphism means forms.

The ability to represent in different forms is called polymorphism.

The main objective of polymorphism is to provide flexibility.

In java we have two types of polymorphism.

1) Compile time polymorphism / Static polymorphism / Early Binding
2) Runtime polymorphism / Dynamic polymorphism / Late Binding 

1) Compile time polymorphism
---------------------------
A polymorphism which exhibits at compile time is called compile time polymorphism.
ex:	
	Method overloading 
	Method Hiding 

2) Runtime polymorphism 
-----------------------
A polymorphism which exhibits at runtime is called runtime polymorphism.
ex:
	Method Overriding
